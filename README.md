# Altris Residence â€“ Shuttle Countdown ðŸšŒ

This project is now a Kotlin Spring Boot application that serves the same single page schedule viewer.

## Run locally

Use a local Gradle installation:

```bash
gradle bootRun
```

If you prefer to use the wrapper, run `gradle wrapper` once to download
`gradle-wrapper.jar` and then execute `./gradlew bootRun`.

Visit `http://localhost:8080` to see the countdown page.
